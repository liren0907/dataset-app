2. **Phase 2 (1 day):** Enhance label extraction tool discoverability 
3. **Phase 3 (1 day):** Apply visual improvements and spacing
4. **Phase 4 (Assessment):** Evaluate if Image Viewer 3 still provides value
5. **Phase 5 (Optional):** Deprecate Image Viewer 3 after user acceptance

#### **ALTERNATIVE: SPECIALIZED TOOL ROLE** ⚡

If users prefer the single-page workflow of Image Viewer 3:
- **Keep for specialized export workflows**
- **Add performance optimizations** from Dataset Gallery
- **Maintain as expert tool** alongside general-purpose Dataset Gallery

## Updated Conclusion

**Recommendation:** **IMPORT UI PATTERNS & CONSIDER RETIREMENT**

The performance optimization integration has **fundamentally changed the comparison**. Dataset Gallery now has:
- **Superior technical performance** (30-50% faster loading)
- **Better architectural foundation** (modular, maintainable)
- **Equivalent or better core functionality** (viewing, annotations, export)

Image Viewer 3's remaining value is primarily in **UI/UX patterns** that can be imported with relatively low effort (3-5 days total).

**Decision Point:** After importing the UI improvements, evaluate whether Image Viewer 3 provides sufficient unique value to justify ongoing maintenance, or whether it can be safely retired in favor of the enhanced Dataset Gallery.

**Timeline Estimate:** 3-5 days for UI pattern migration
**Technical Risk:** Low (additive improvements only)
**User Impact:** Positive (enhanced UX with same functionality)
**Maintenance Impact:** Potential reduction by consolidating to single primary viewer
